# Demos

We have setup 3 demos demonstrating `swebRequest` features. 

1. [The main demo website](wbox/index.md): this site demostrates all the different features and strategies of `swebRequest` in different modes:
	- [standalone](../modes/standalone/index.md)
	- [standalong](../modes/standalong/index.md)
	- [workbox](../modes/workbox/index.md)
2. [A Wordpress site](wordpress/index.md):
	- we installed and run a wordpress website at https://wp.doitsec.net
	- deployed a plugin that adds `swebRequest` to it. The goal is to publish this Wordpress plugin and makes it easy for the many Wordpress sites to easily use `swebRequest` and its features.
3. [A Mitmproxy server](bbox/index.md) that makes it possible to quickly test `swebRequest` features on any website
